   - Serves static files and handles requests for cookie data.

2. **package.json**  
   - A required configuration file that manages dependencies and startup scripts.  
   - Defines **"express"** and **"nodemon"** as dependencies for the project.  
   - Ensures proper execution of the application using `npm run dev`.

3. **package-lock.json**
